\title{The Genomic Basis of Local Adaptation in Maize}

\maketitle

\section*{Funding targets} 

\subsection*{Catalyzing New International Collaborations (NSF)}
Due Date:  Rolling acceptance. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Need to submit request for support to NSF Plant Genome prior to submitting grant.

\item Funds two meetings to discuss grants/preliminary data, two seasons of line development, sequencing of mapping population parents and/or GBS of populations.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Plant Genome Research Program (NSF)}
Due Date: March 2014. 

\subsubsection*{Components}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item QTL Mapping of Highland Adaptation
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  Mapping populations of highland x lowland crosses from Mexico and South America (Sherry and Ruairidh).
	
		\item parviglumis x mexicana cross: John Doebley has DNA of Lauter (mex x parv) x maize BC1 population and potentially seed from both this population and a mex x parv population studied by Anna Westerbergh.

		\item  Further functional characterization of QTL?
	 \end{enumerate}

	\item Admixture mapping using populations from mex/parv hybrid zones (Graham Coop): Matt would collect and phenotype.

	\item Contribution of mexicana introgression to local adaptation: analyses at a finer scale than Hufford et al. 2013, assessment of selection on introgressed regions (Jeff)

	\item Global analysis of highland haps and/or Fst in low/high pops (Oaxa, Ethiopia, Guatemala, etc.) (Matt)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Outstanding questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Where will the grow outs take place?  Puerto Rico (Sherryâ€™s committed to this site due to other grants), Mexico, Hawaii?

	\item What will South American cross include?  
	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Outbred highland landraces X lowland Doebley inbred (Sherry will set this up summer 2013)? 

		\item Doubled haploid highland landrace X lowland Doebley inbred (Matt will set this up in growth chamber and request lowland inbred seed from Sherry)?

		\item Highland Murray inbred X lowland Doebley inbred
\end{enumerate}

\item  Do we want to include ancient DNA?  Ancient DNA is available from Mexico and South America from highland and lowland (?) sites. Useful?

\item  Do we measure other (harder) phenotypes?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Root chilling
	\item UV sensitivity
	\item Germination
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
