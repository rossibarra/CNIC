\title{The Genomic Basis of Local Adaptation in Maize}

\maketitle

\section*{Catalyzing New International Collaborations (NSF)}
Due Date:  Rolling acceptance. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Need to submit request for support to NSF Plant Genome prior to submitting grant.

\item Funds two meetings to discuss grants/preliminary data, two seasons of line development, sequencing of mapping population parents and/or GBS of populations.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Plant Genome Research Program (NSF)}
Due Date: March 2014. 

\subsection*{Components}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Genetic architecture of highland adaptation
	
	{\bf Questions:} What is the genetic basis of highland adaptation?  How much is shared between Mexico and S. America? Between maize and teosinte? 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item QTL of high x low in Mexico and S. America (SFG (\& RS?))
		
		SFG on S. America and Mexico? 
		
		Grow both high and low? Who does which?

		\item parviglumis x mexicana cross
		
		Doebley has seed of TC1: (mex x parv) x A158 (who?) 
		\item Admixture mapping in mex/parv hybrid zone (GC \& MBH)

		GC on analysis, new theory (better precision mapping?)
		
		MBH on phenotyping and genotyping
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Adaptation and introgression
	
	{\bf Questions:} Are introgressed loci adaptive? Does evidence of natural selection correspond to QTL? Are highland haplotype widespread in maize adapted to highland climes?
	\begin{enumerate}	
		\item Increased depth/precision version Hufford et al. 2013 (JRI)

		\item Global analysis of highland haps and/or Fst in low/high pops (Oaxaca, Ethiopia, Guatemala, etc.) (Matt)
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Functional characterization of QTL
	
	{\bf Questions:} What do the QTL (or selected/introgressed loci) do?
	
	Something here about RS's NILs or other introgression pops. (RS)

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Outstanding questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Where will growouts take place?  Puerto Rico (SFG), Mexico, Hawaii?
	\item Do we do highland and lowland sites for all phenotyping?
	\item What will South American cross include?  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Outbred highland landraces X lowland Doebley inbred (SFG will set this up summer 2013)? 
		\item DH highland landrace X lowland Doebley inbred (MBH growth chamber w/ seed Sherry)?
		\item Highland Murray inbred X lowland Doebley inbred
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Do we try to drill down on small set of gene(s)?
	\item Should we include SW US material?
	\item Do we include parv x mex cross and if so who does it?
	\item What are broader impacts/outreach? Continue exchange program?
	\item Monthly and annual meetings?
	\item Students/pdocs/shared field work?
	\item Do we measure other (harder) phenotypes?
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Root chilling
		\item UV sensitivity
		\item Germination
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Can we leverage SEED data?
	\item Basic budget (personnel, sequencing, field facilities)?
	\item Basic timeline?

\end{enumerate}
